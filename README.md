# Word Search II: Words Worth Finding:

In this document, we explore three different approaches to solving the Word Search II problem, a LeetCode hard problem. The objective is to find all the words that can be constructed from adjacent cells in a given 2D matrix. Words are formed from adjacent cells on the board, and each letter on the board can be used only once in a single word.

## Problem Statement

**Expected Input**: 
- A 2D matrix of characters representing the board 
- An array of strings representing the list of words

**Expected Output**: 
- An array of strings representing words found on the board

## Solutions:

We discuss three different approaches:

1. **Backtracking with Trie (BTT)**
2. **DFS with Trie (DFST)**
3. **DFS with Set (DFSS)**

### 1. Backtracking with Trie (BTT)

This method makes use of backtracking along with a Trie data structure to store the word list. It's particularly good for finding all possible words on the board and can be highly efficient for small to medium-sized boards or word lists.

#### Strengths:

- Efficient for finding all possible words on the board.
- Can be highly efficient for small to medium-sized boards or word lists.

#### Weaknesses:

- Implementation complexity due to combining backtracking and Trie.

### 2. DFS with Trie (DFST)

Using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in conjunction with a Trie, this approach is more straightforward to implement compared to the BTT approach. It remains efficient for small to medium-sized boards or lists of words.

#### Strengths:

- Simpler to implement compared to the BTT approach.
- Efficient for small to medium-sized boards or word lists.

#### Weaknesses:

- Like BTT, implementation can become complicated with larger data structures.

### 3. DFS with Set (DFSS)

This approach employs DFS but instead of using a Trie, it makes use of a Set. It's the easiest among the three to implement. However, it might not be as efficient for larger datasets, and there's a possibility that not all paths would be explored.

#### Strengths:

- Easiest to implement among the three.
- Good for finding a subset of words on the board.

#### Weaknesses:

- May not explore all possible paths, making it less thorough than the previous two methods.
- Could be slower for larger boards or word lists.

## Conclusion:

The optimal approach largely depends on the specifics of the task at hand: the size of the board, the length of words, the frequency of updates to the word list, and so on. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method, developers can make an informed decision about which one is the most appropriate for their needs.
